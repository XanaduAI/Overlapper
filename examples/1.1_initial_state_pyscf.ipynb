    "Multireference perturbation theory works on top of a CASCI solution to correct for the frozen orbitals missing from the active space. It works by modifying in-place the wavefunction coefficients stored in a CASCI solver. As most perturbation theory approaches, it only mildly changes the wavefunction."
